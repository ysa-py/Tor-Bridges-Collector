## Iran DPI Intelligence

Iran's censorship infrastructure (SIAM) uses:
- **TLS fingerprinting** — JA3 hash matching for known Tor patterns (`e7d705a3286e19ea42f587b344ee6865`)
- **Port-based blocking** — Ports 9001, 9030, 9050 are consistently blocked
- **IP-based blocking** — Known Tor relay/bridge IPs are blocklisted within 24–48 h of first use
- **Traffic volume anomaly detection** — Unusual traffic shapes are flagged

### Recommended Transport Priority for Iran

```
Snowflake → WebTunnel (CDN-fronted) → obfs4 (port 443) → meek-lite → vanilla
```

## Classification Definitions

| Status | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `iran_likely_working` | OONI shows clean results from Iranian probes in last 7 days |
| `iran_likely_blocked` | OONI shows anomaly/confirmed block from Iranian probes |
| `iran_frequently_blocked` | Recurrence rate > 2 blocks per 30-day period |
| `iran_unknown` | No OONI data from Iranian probes; TCP reachable from GitHub Actions |
| `tcp_unreachable` | TCP connection failed from GitHub Actions runner (likely globally down) |
| `iran_asn_blocked` | Bridge IP resolves to an Iranian ISP ASN — excluded from all packs |

---

## DPI Risk Flags

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `iran_dpi_high_risk` | Bridge uses a JA3 fingerprint or port known to Iran's DPI blocklist |
| `iran_port_high_risk` | Bridge is on port 9001, 9030, or 9050 |
| `domain_front_degraded` | WebTunnel front domain resolves to a non-CDN IP |
| `domain_front_cdn_ok` | WebTunnel front domain resolves to a known CDN (Cloudflare, Azure, Fastly) |
